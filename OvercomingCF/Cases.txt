case 1: one class in each set with different instances with the same applied noise function (set size = 100 instances) 

case 2: different calsses, in each set same noise fucntion but between sets different noise fucntions (set size = 100 instances).

case 3: different classes, in each set same noise function but between sets different different set sizes. 

case 4: different classes, in each set same noise function and same set size but different size of sequential runs.

case 5: for each instance (same class, same noise function, oversampled), different instances between sequential runs, same or differnt noise fucntion between sequential runs.
